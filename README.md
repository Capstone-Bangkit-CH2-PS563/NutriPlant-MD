# **NutriPlant Mobile Develoment Project**<br /><br />
This MD project is final project for Google Bangkit Academy 2023.<br /><br />
Project Background: The capstone project, the NutriPlant, was initiated to address a gap in existing applications related to nutrition tracking and food scanning. While there were various apps, focusing on nutrition tracking and ingredient analysis, there seemed to be a specific need for a mobile application that specializes in vegetable nutrition. The goal was to leverage machine learning technology to analyze and identify vegetables, assess their freshness levels, and provide detailed information on nutrients and benefits.<br /><br />
